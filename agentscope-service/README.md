# AgentScope Service

> **An Agent as a Service platform for business applications: submit work through APIs, stay involved, and retrieve reviewable results and deliverables.**

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

AgentScope Service publishes Agents that research, use tools, and verify results as callable services. Applications can generate customer proposals in a CRM, verify documents in a pipeline, investigate incidents and create PRs in an engineering product, provide an interactive specialist assistant, or run scheduled background tasks.

Users start work and review delivery inside their existing product. Service runs and coordinates Agents and exposes their interactions. Application teams own business tools, data authorization, the interface, and result acceptance. See [Use cases](../docs/v2/en/service/usecases.md) for integration designs.

## Capabilities

### From task to delivery through APIs

Create or connect an Agent, configure resources, and publish an Endpoint. Applications call it with Application credentials, retain the Invocation ID, and read status, snapshots, events, pending actions, and artifacts. Jobs serve independent background work; Conversations serve session-capable single Agents. Each task or conversation turn has its own Invocation.

Endpoints define input/output contracts and releases. Applications use queries, SSE, or Webhooks to receive changes, involve people in decisions, and return verified results to a business process. Execution completion and business acceptance are separate stages.

Start with the [API quickstart](../docs/v2/en/service/first-session.md), then follow [Endpoint publishing](../docs/v2/en/service/endpoints.md) and [Unified service API](../docs/v2/en/service/service-api.md). Managed native session, file, subagent, and checkpoint APIs provide their respective extensions; their IDs, authentication, and event cursors are not interchangeable with public Invocations.

### Choose execution for the task

- **Managed:** Define a specialist Agent through instructions, models, tools, and resources. Service runs AgentScope Harness, while tools execute in the configured Environment. Deploy the platform on your own infrastructure.
- **External:** Connect an existing AgentScope or other framework application, retaining its process and deployment. Implement task execution, event reporting, and supported controls.
- **Hosted:** Reuse Coding Agents such as Codex or Claude Code through a Runtime Host that manages provider processes and work directories.

Validate delivery with one Agent first. Use a Team for dynamic delegation or a Workflow for explicit steps, conditions, and human gates. Callers continue to consume an Endpoint and follow its Invocation. Teams and Workflows currently provide Jobs; interaction support depends on runtime capabilities.

### Shared management and observation

The Control Plane manages the Agent catalog, bindings, releases, application identity, task coordination, and public invocations. Managed Agents, External Applications, and Runtime Hosts cooperate through durable execution contracts. Console is the visual interface for API configuration, task inspection, and operations; business users can stay in their own product.

Workspaces, Environments, Memory, and Vault organize execution resources. Application identity and business end-user identity require separate handling: different credentials in one Application do not automatically isolate users' tasks. Configure CRM, GitHub, order-system, and other connections in the integration.

## Architecture

### How it works

Business applications submit and observe work through Endpoint / Invocation APIs. Developers configure capabilities through management APIs or Console. The Control Plane coordinates three execution models:

- `managed`: hosted AgentScope Harness execution;
- `external-application`: user applications built with AgentScope, LangChain, Claude Agent SDK, and others, registered through Application SDK / ASDP;
- `hosted-runtime`: task-scoped Codex, Claude Code, and similar processes run by Runtime Host daemons;

### Production deployment architecture

In production, the recommended AgentScope Service deployment looks like this:

![AgentScope Service](/docs/imgs/agentservice/agentscope-service-production-deploy.png)


| Plane | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | Public entry, authentication, and API routing | Business state and Agent execution |
| Control Plane (`service-controlplane`) | Product resources, publishing and Invocations, public events, task coordination, runtime commands | Harness inference and native Managed Session event generation |
| Dataplane | Managed Harness Runtime, event log, SSE, Turn Lease, HITL, and Work Queue | Direct reads of product Catalog tables |
| Scheduler | Channel, Cron, outbound jobs, and Self-hosted Hands Workers | The inference loop |


## How Agents attach

Application developers can validate a call with the [API quickstart](../docs/v2/en/service/first-session.md). Platform teams prepare models, execution resources, identities, and releases. Existing applications implement the [External execution adapter](../docs/v2/en/service/register-agentscope-agent.md) before publishing a service.

## Release deployment and documentation

For published-image Docker and Helm installation, see the [deployment guide](deploy/README.md) and [release runbook](release/README.md). The complete [Service documentation](../docs/v2/en/service/index.md) covers usage and operations. The local startup instructions below are for development and include demo users and optional database resets.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- JDK 17+
- Maven
- Go 1.26+
- A model API key; the example below uses DashScope

Node.js 22 is required for a fresh local source checkout or a console rebuild. Published-image deployments do not require Node.js.

### 1. Start the local stack

From the monorepo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-java.git
cd agentscope-java

export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxx
cd agentscope-service
scripts/dev-down.sh && BUILDER_REBUILD=1 scripts/dev-up.sh
```

This starts PostgreSQL, `service-controlplane`, the data plane, scheduler, and gateway. Local development sets `CONTROL_PLANE_ENABLE_KUBERNETES=false`; CRD reconcilers and ASDP gRPC are not required for the hosted product flow.
Because the project has not been released and v4 deliberately replaces the legacy execution schema, `BUILDER_REBUILD=1` also recreates the disposable `cp`, `rt`, and `dp` development schemas. Use `BUILDER_RESET_DB=0` only when an already-v4 local database must be preserved. The startup script verifies all three schemas and the terminal collaboration/orchestration migrations before reporting success; run `scripts/smoke.sh` for the API-level end-to-end check.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Console and public API | http://localhost:18080 |
| Default login | `admin` / `admin` |
| Additional seed users | `alice` / `alice`, `bob` / `bob` |
| Logs and local state | `.dev-stack/` |

Default users and development secrets are for local use only.

### 2. Run your first session

1. Open http://localhost:18080 and sign in (`admin` / `admin`).
2. In **Managed Agents**, create an Agent.
3. In the local development stack, a new Managed Agent is automatically bound to a shared `default-local` Environment. You can select a different Environment in Agent settings.
4. Open **Sessions**, create a session, and send the first message.
5. In **Dashboard**, inspect online status, events, and runtime state.
6. For collaboration, create a persistent **Team**, assign an Issue, and inspect discussion routes and AgentTasks.

To try BYO Agent registration, use the sample at `agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-paw`. After it starts, the agent should appear in the Dashboard.

To bring **DeepSeek Harness** into the same fleet, load the Cordis plugin at `agentscope-service/service-controlplane/sdk/dsh` (`@agentscope/dsh-controlplane`). It self-registers with service-controlplane, serves `/agentscope/*`, receives AgentTask events, and uses the same Issue/Comment/Artifact contract as other runtimes. See that directory's [README](service-controlplane/sdk/dsh/README.md).


### 3. Stop the stack

```bash
scripts/dev-down.sh
```

## Development

### Build the backend

Run the Maven build from the monorepo root so all AgentScope snapshots used by the service jars are current:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests

cd agentscope-service/service-controlplane
make build
make test
```

### Build or run the console

```bash
cd agentscope-service/frontend
npm install
npm run build   # emits static assets into ../service-controlplane/ui

npm run dev     # Vite HMR; /api proxies to the gateway
```

### Run with Docker Compose

Build the Java artifacts first, then start the containerized stack:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests
docker compose -f agentscope-service/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### Service ports

| Service | Port | Exposure |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Gateway | 18080 | Public (container port 8080 with Docker Compose) |
| `service-controlplane` | 8081 | Internal |
| Data plane | 8082 | Internal |
| Scheduler | 8083 | Internal |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Local infrastructure |

### Configuration

Java services use `builder.*` properties and `BUILDER_*` environment variables. All planes must agree on authentication secrets and internal URLs.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | DashScope model credential for local turns |
| `BUILDER_JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret shared by gateway/control components |
| `BUILDER_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | Secret for trusted plane-to-plane requests |
| `BUILDER_VAULT_MASTER_KEY` | Encryption key for vault credentials |
| `BUILDER_DB_URL`, `BUILDER_DB_USER`, `BUILDER_DB_PASSWORD` | Java data-plane database |
| `BUILDER_CONTROL_URL`, `BUILDER_DATA_URL`, `BUILDER_SCHEDULER_URL` | Internal service endpoints |
| `BUILDER_E2B_API_KEY` | E2B credential for `sandbox` environments |
| `BUILDER_ALLOW_LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT` | Allows new `local` Environment bindings. Defaults to `false` in `service-controlplane`; `scripts/dev-up.sh` and the development Compose stack opt in. Keep disabled in production. |
| `CONTROL_PLANE_PRODUCT_DSN` | Product database used by `service-controlplane` |
| `CONTROL_PLANE_ENABLE_KUBERNETES` | Enables Control Plane CRD reconcilers and Kubernetes integration |
| `BUILDER_REBUILD=1` | Rebuilds the monorepo/service-controlplane and, by default, recreates the disposable local `cp`/`rt`/`dp` schemas |
| `BUILDER_RESET_DB=0` | Preserves an already-v4 local database during a full binary rebuild |
| `BUILDER_SMOKE_TEST=1` | Runs `scripts/smoke.sh` automatically after health and SQL-schema verification |

Production deployments must replace all development credentials and use durable PostgreSQL.


## Roadmap

Further development focuses on application integration and delivery: end-user authorization, file input contracts, automatic triggers through the public invocation path, and continued validation of long tasks, complex orchestration, and cost governance.
